# Module 8: Deep Learning with PyTorch

1. PyTorch is currently a leading machine learning framework, do you think that will change? Please explain your response to both questions.
 
I think it is almost inevitable that other frameworks will come along and replace or supplement PyTorch at some point, though when this might happen is beyond my ability and knowledge to predict. But certainly PyTorch is a central framework for ML tasks at least for short- and mid-run.  This is particularly due to its simple Python- and NumPy-based interface and its ability to run in parallel natively on current GPU architectures.  It is also open-source with a robust community active around it. But with quantum computing seemingly on the horizon as well as other computer architectures and programming paradigms, other frameworks will certainly arise and will likely replace current technologies as research, industry, and consumer needs shift.

2. Given the explosion of LLMs that can translate between programming languages and packages, does it even make sense to learn new frameworks? 

LLMs without question are changing the coding and technology landscapes. Indeed, LLMs and generative AI are changing almost all fields: research in the public health and the social sciences, for example, are increasingly incorporating language models (and ML approaches more broadly) into research methodologies and for increasing research productivity. Chatbots built into coding tools increase coder productivity and reduce bugs. But LLMs and associated technologies are making the mastery of the fundamentals even more important: understanding the assumptions of the models, proper interpretation of model output (when appropriate), and ability to communicate model outputs in a way understandable to a variety of stakeholders. Mastering these fundamentals only comes about with a solid theoretical basis of the mathematical principles of these models and a significant amount of experience.  Frameworks will come and go, and LLMs are certainly making it less important to memorize all the details, but a solid grasp of the foundations will certainly remain an essential component for success in the field of data science.
